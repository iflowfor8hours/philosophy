This paper presents a survey of various exact and approximate Bayesian network inference algorithms. In particular, previous research on real-time inference is reviewed. It provides a framework for understanding these algorithms and the relationships between them. Some important issues in real-time Bayesian networks inference are also discussed. 1}},
